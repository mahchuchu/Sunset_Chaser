You are a Cloudian, a cloud citizen, fascinated by the disappearing sun submerging below the horizon to the point you will run endlessly, jumping from cloud to cloud, until you're satisfied from it's overwhelming beauty.

However, you cannot run on all clouds, there will be angry, merciless ones that despise everything in existence for no apparent reason.  Avoid them at all cost or you will become a part of them and your curious, sun-passionate self will cease to exist.
